# Linked List Fundamentals


## Why you should know this

Linked Lists are a fundamental linear data structure that stores a collection of elements. 

By understanding linked lists you will be able to exercise your ability to compare and contrast data structures in terms of time and space.

You will also practice using programming fundamentals and object oriented programming to construct a basic linked list structure.

## What is a Linked List

### Review of Arrays (optional)

Like an array, a linked list is a linear data structure. Linear data structures are used to organize information in a sequential manner. Arrays and linked lists both implement the List abstract data type. Any data structure that implements a list can store information that is similar to a list you might use in real life. 

Insert todo list

We learned previously that the information stored in an array is contiguous in memory, which is a fancy way of saying the information is stored right next to each other in physical memory, a lot like a row of storage lockers. 

This property of arrays makes it easy to access information quickly using basic arithmetic. However, we found that in order to maintain the contiguous property of arrays we need to do a lot of shuffling around when we make certain modifications to the array like inserting or deleting, which can be expensive in terms of time.

### Linked Lists to the Rescue

That's where linked lists come in! Linked lists are **not** placed contiguously in memory which makes them more efficient in terms of time for insert and delete operations.

You can think of a linked list being placed in memory like .

insert ll pic

In a basic singly list which is what we will focus on in this lesson, we are always given access to the start of the linked list using a reference that is typically called the `head`. 

Check for understanding

Without the head of the linked list we cannot access any other element in the
